1. [**Class discussion board: Announcements are here, and you can ask for help here too.**](https://github.com/orgs/LeDataSciFi/teams/classmates-2023)
   - This discussion board is a "team" inside of our [LDSF github "organization"](https://github.com/orgs/LeDataSciFi) 
   - Our org also has repos: All the files that make that website [are online "in the cloud" here](https://github.com/LeDataSciFi/ledatascifi-2023) and I've cloned this to my computer so I can sync it and get new fles. The other repos are for data we will use and some previous student projects.
